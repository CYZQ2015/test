Neural network and support vector machine for the prediction of chronic kidney disease: A comparative study
神经网络和SVM在慢性肾病预测上的应用：一种比较研究

This paper aims to assist in the prevention of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) by utilizing machine learning techniques to diagnose CKD at an early stage. Kidney diseases are disorders that disrupt the normal function of the kidney. As the percentage of patients affected by CKD is significantly increasing, effective prediction procedures should be considered. In this paper, we focus on applying different machine learning classification algorithms to a dataset of 400 patients and 24 attributes related to diagnosis of chronic kidney disease. The classification techniques used in this study include Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). To perform experiments, all missing values in the dataset were replaced by the mean of the corresponding attributes. Then, the optimized parameters for the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) techniques were determined by tuning the parameters and performing several experiments. The final models of the two proposed techniques were developed using the best-obtained parameters and features. The empirical results from the experiments indicated that ANN performed better than SVM, with accuracies of 99.75% and 97.75%, respectively, indicating that the outcome of this study is very promising.
本文旨在利用机器学习技术在早期诊断慢性肾脏疾病(CKD)，以帮助预防慢性肾脏疾病(CKD)。肾脏疾病是破坏肾脏正常功能的疾病。随着CKD患者比例的显著增加，应考虑有效的预测程序。在这篇论文中，我们重点将不同的机器学习分类算法应用于一个包含400名患者和24个与慢性肾脏疾病诊断相关属性的数据集。本研究使用的分类技术包括人工神经网络(ANN)和支持向量机(SVM)。为了执行实验，数据集中所有缺失的值都被相应属性的平均值所代替。然后，通过调整参数并进行多次实验，确定了人工神经网络(ANN)和支持向量机(SVM)技术的优化参数。利用获得的最佳参数和特征，建立了两种方法的最终模型。实验的实证结果表明，ANN的表现优于SVM，准确率分别为99.75%和97.75%，说明本研究的结果是很有希望的。
